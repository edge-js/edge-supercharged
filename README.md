# Edge Supercharged
> Supercharge your components and use them as edge tags

Edge supercharged enables you to use your components as edge tags. It began by scanning all the templates stored inside the `./components` directory of your view root and make them available as tags.

## Usage
Install the package from npm registry as follows

```sh
npm i edge-supercharged

# yarn
yarn add edge-supercharged
```

And use it as follows

```ts
const edge = require('edge.js').default
const { Supercharged } = require('edge-supercharged')

const supercharged = new Supercharged()
edge.use(supercharged.wire, {
  recurring: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'
})
```

During development, you must set the `recurring` option to true, so that edge reapplies the plugin on each render call. This will allow `edge-supercharged` to re-discover the components from the filesystem.

## Creating components

The components must live inside the `./components` directory relative to the views directory and then you can reference your components as tags.

Instead of using the component as follows

```edge
@component('button', { type: 'submit' })
  <span> Submit form </span>
@end
```

You can use it as follows:

```edge
@button({ type: 'submit' })
  <span> Submit form </span>
@end
```
